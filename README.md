# CPU EMULATOR

### Processor Architecture Emulator (College project)

This project implements an emulator for a custom processor architecture. The processor's programming model includes the following features:

    ðŸ”¹ Four 64-bit general-purpose registers
    ðŸ”¹ A program counter
    ðŸ”¹ A 64-bit address space
    ðŸ”¹ 1-byte length for the content of each memory address

### Instruction Set

The instruction set of the emulator includes:

    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        ðŸ”¹ ADD (Addition)
        ðŸ”¹ SUB (Subtraction)
        ðŸ”¹ MUL (Multiplication)
        ðŸ”¹ DIV (Division)

    Basic Bitwise Logical Operations:
        ðŸ”¹ AND (Bitwise AND)
        ðŸ”¹ OR (Bitwise OR)
        ðŸ”¹ NOT (Bitwise NOT)
        ðŸ”¹ XOR (Bitwise XOR)

    Data Transfer Instructions:
        ðŸ”¹ MOV (Move) with support for both direct and indirect addressing

    Branching Instructions:
        ðŸ”¹ JMP (Unconditional Jump)
        ðŸ”¹ JE (Jump if Equal)
        ðŸ”¹ JNE (Jump if Not Equal)
        ðŸ”¹ JGE (Jump if Greater or Equal)
        ðŸ”¹ JL (Jump if Less)
        ðŸ”¹ CMP (Compare) with support for both direct and indirect branching

    I/O Routines:
        ðŸ”¹ Read a character from the keyboard into a register
        ðŸ”¹ Output a character from a register to the screen

    Processor Control:
        ðŸ”¹ HALT (Stop Processor)
        ðŸ”¹ RESUME (Resume Processor)

### Example of usage

You can write text file that utilizes commands described above and save it to src/java/main/input directory. There are 2 example files already. You can than load them in application using file load command:
```
fl file_name.txt
```
Now you can step through each line of code using step(s) command, or just run entire program using run command.

Using help command, you can see other useful commands.
